# Is the Apple Watch ECG feature available in Japan yet?

To find out, go here: https://einichi.github.io/is-apple-watch-ecg-in-japan-yet

Uses Puppeteer to check https://www.apple.com/watchos/feature-availability and see if Japan is listed under the ECG section.

Uses GitHub actions to run the check periodically and take output from Puppeteer and put it into a basic site templated with Jekyll hosted on GitHub Pages.
